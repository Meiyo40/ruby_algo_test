for i = 000 to i = 999
Print in ascending order the different possible combinations.
Always 3 characters, each number of these 3 characters can appear only once (022 is invalid).
The same combination in a different order is also invalid (if 123 is listed, 213/321... cant).

NB: I'm not ruby dev this is a simple test.
